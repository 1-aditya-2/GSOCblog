      <p>
        So I guess you all must have heard about GSOC. But do you actually know about it?
         Well, we are here to help you.<br />

First let's start with the full form (as I know many of you still don't know).GSOC stands
for Google Summer of Code. It is a global online platform to bring new and enthusiastic
developers into the world of open source software development. It is an initiative of
Google that helps various open source organizations to connect with contributors and help
them on various projects.<br />

So after reading the word "open source" so many times, you must be thinking what is this.
Basically the term Open Source refers to something which can be modified by anyone and the
source code is publicly accessible. And GSOC contains the open source projects of various
organizations in which you can contribute (after getting selected, of course).<br /> <br />

<b>
Google Summer of Code is a 3-month program where various open-source organizations
list their problem statements or projects and students all over the world give their
proposals for the projects listed. If the student is selected, then a mentor will be
assigned to each student and the student will contribute to that project under the
guidance of the assigned mentor. </b>

      <p class="bodyR">
        The main aim of GSOC is to provide the required exposure to the beginners
        of the IT sector. It helps students to work collaboratively and learn from
        experienced professionals.<br />

Apart from that, GSOC also helps to apply your learned skills and also learn a bunch
of new ones. Secondly, it also makes your RESUME look more attractive and stand out
among others.<br />

Finally, who doesn’t like money!? You get a stipend for the amount of time you spend
working for the companies.<br />

GSoC is one of the best professional experiences a student can have during her/his college years.

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
